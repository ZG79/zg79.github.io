## HTML

## When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?
An unordered list in HTML is used to represent a list of items that don't have a specific order or ranking. This type of list is usually displayed with bullet points.

You should use an unordered list when you want to present a collection of items that don't have a particular order or hierarchy. Some common examples of when to use an unordered list include:

A list of ingredients for a recipe
A list of items in a shopping cart
A list of tasks in a to-do list
A list of items in a navigation menu
A list of options in a form
In HTML, an unordered list is created using the 'ul' element, and each list item is represented by the 'li' element.
##  How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?
  Unordered list's bullet style can be changed by using CSS. The default bullet style for an unordered list is a filled circle, but you can change it to any other symbol, image, or character using the list-style-type property in CSS.
  
  Here are some of the other possible values for the list-style-type property:

disc: Filled circle

circle: Outlined circle

square: Square

decimal: Decimal number

lower-roman: Lowercase Roman numeral

upper-roman: Uppercase Roman numeral

lower-alpha: Lowercase letters

upper-alpha: Uppercase letters

none: No bullet

## When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?

- A list of instructions or steps to follow

- A list of items in a numbered list

  ## Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?
  
  There are two main ways to change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list in HTML:

1. Using CSS: You can use the CSS list-style-type property to change the numbering type of an ordered list. 
2. Using the type attribute: You can also change the numbering type of an ordered list by using the type attribute on the <ol> element. The type attribute accepts values such as a, A, i, and I, which correspond to lowercase letters, uppercase letters, lowercase Roman numerals, and uppercase Roman numerals, respectively.
