## HTML 
### The href attribute contains what information?

Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address. Almost any web content can be converted to a link so that when clicked or otherwise activated the web browser goes to another web address (URL).

  a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">the Mozilla homepage</a
  
 ### To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
 
 To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside the <a> (anchor) element.
  
  ### What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
  
  Adding suitable semantic links. For example Screen readers will identify all headers and use them to make programmatic associations between those headers and the cells they relate to. The combination of column and row headers will identify and interpret the data in each cell so that screen reader users can interpret the table similarly to how a sighted user does.
  
  ## CSS
  
  ### What is meant by “normal flow”?
  
  In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), "normal flow" refers to the default behavior of elements in a document before any layout or positioning properties are applied.

In normal flow, elements are laid out in their natural order within the document flow, and their positions are determined by the order in which they appear in the HTML code, as well as the size and position of their parent container.

Elements are positioned vertically one after the other, with each element taking up the full width of its parent container by default. Elements are also stacked in the order in which they appear in the HTML, with later elements appearing on top of earlier ones.

Normal flow can be modified by using CSS positioning properties such as position, top, bottom, left, and right, as well as properties such as float, clear, and display.
