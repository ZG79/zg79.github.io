# Psychological Safety

### What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

I learned from the Google Project Aristotle, that most important two factors that contribute to be healthy team are: 
- Conversational turn-taking : Which is every team members are encouraged and given opportunity to speak up and share their thougths. 
- Average social sensitivity: How well the team members are reading each other's feeling based on their tone of the voice, or their expressions, and nonverbal cues. 

The next important factors are: 
- Having clear goals together
- Creating a culture of dependability. 

### Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

I would rate my current job team's psychological safety as somewhere between 6-7. The reason I can't rate more than 7 is, our team has a very strong personalities and when there is a meeting, usually small group of people would take over, so most of the team members feel like they weren't given enough opportunity to speak their mind. But we have a very clear goal as a team and we are very dependable. 

### What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

Most of the times teams works are stronger and more efficient than the individual works.If the psychological safety is one of the most important factors of strong team, then not only the company will be very successful as a business and team members satisfaction level will be higher. I assume it will prevent turn over rates.
