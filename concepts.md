## Constructive vs Class functions

class Odd {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

function Odd (name) {
this.name = name;
} 

These two code snippets are the same in terms of functionality.

The first code snippet defines a class named "Odd" that has a constructor method which takes a parameter "name" and assigns the parameter value to a property "this.name" of the object being created.

The second code snippet defines a constructor function named "Odd" that takes a parameter "name" and assigns the parameter value to a property "this.name" of the object being created.

Both code snippets use the same syntax to assign the "name" parameter to the "this.name" property of the object, so they achieve the same functionality.

However, it's worth noting that the syntax for defining classes in JavaScript was introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), while the syntax for defining constructor functions has been available since the early versions of JavaScript. So, the class syntax may not be supported in older browsers, whereas the constructor function syntax is supported in all versions of JavaScript.

## Some advantages to using classes over constructor functions in JavaScript:

- Classes provide a more concise syntax for creating objects with shared behavior. By defining a class, you can define a set of methods that are shared among all instances of that class, which can make your code more modular and easier to read.

- Classes provide a clear separation of concerns between the constructor function and the methods of the class. In constructor functions, you have to define all the methods on the prototype object, which can make the code harder to read and maintain. In classes, you can define methods directly in the class definition, which makes the code more organized and easier to understand.

- Classes provide better support for inheritance and polymorphism. You can define a class that extends another class to inherit all of its behavior, and you can create multiple subclasses that share a common interface. This makes it easier to write reusable code and to manage complex code bases.

### However, constructor functions also have some advantages over classes:

- Constructor functions are supported by all versions of JavaScript, while classes were introduced in ES6. If you need to support older browsers or environments that don't support ES6, you may need to use constructor functions instead of classes.

- Constructor functions provide more flexibility for defining object behavior. Because you define all the methods on the prototype object, you can use more advanced patterns like closures or function factories to create objects with more complex behavior.

Overall, while there are advantages to using classes in JavaScript, the choice between classes and constructor functions depends on your specific use case and the requirements of your codebase.
