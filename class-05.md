## What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?

Using the "alt" attribute to provide descriptive text for images can improve accessibility, SEO, and the overall user experience of a website.

## How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?
- Use the "alt" attribute: The "alt" attribute is used to provide a text alternative for an image. This is important for users who are visually impaired or who have images turned off in their browser. The alt text should be descriptive and provide a clear understanding of the image's purpose and content.

- Provide context: It is important to provide context for images, particularly if they are used to convey information. This can be done by including descriptive text near the image or by using captions or other contextual information.

- Use descriptive file names: When naming image files, use descriptive, meaningful names that provide context and convey the content of the image.- 

- Consider color contrast: Ensure that there is sufficient contrast between the image and the background. This is particularly important for users with low vision.

- Use scalable vector graphics (SVG): SVG graphics are scalable and can be zoomed in without losing quality. This can help users with low vision or who use screen magnifiers to see the images clearly.

- Use text-based alternatives: For some images, particularly those used for decoration or layout, it may be more appropriate to use text-based alternatives. such as CSS or Unicode characters.


## Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.

The 'figure' element in HTML is used to encapsulate a media object, such as an image, illustration, diagram, audio clip, video clip, or code snippet, along with its caption. The 'figure' element is used to group together the media and its caption, and can be used to provide additional semantic information to the content.

## Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

a GIF image is a type of image file that contains a series of frames to create an animated effect, and is best for simple images with limited colors. An SVG image is based on a vector graphics format, is scalable, and is ideal for complex images with many shapes and lines.

## What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

the best image type to use for displaying screenshots on a website is typically a PNG (Portable Network Graphics) file.

PNG files are best for screenshots because they support high color depth, which means that they can accurately capture the colors and details of the original image. Additionally, PNG files use lossless compression, which means that the image quality is not degraded when the file is saved or shared. This makes them ideal for screenshots, which often contain small text and other details that can become pixelated or blurry with other image formats.

PNG files also support transparency, which can be useful when displaying screenshots on a website. This can be particularly helpful if the website has a background color or image that the screenshot needs to be layered on top of.

  ## Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.
  
  Foreground color is the color of the text or image in the front of an HTML element, while background color is the color of the area behind the text or image. By choosing the right foreground and background colors, web designers can create web pages that are easy to read and visually appealing to users.
  
  ## Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?
  
 - Choose a color scheme: One of the first steps in adding color to a website is choosing a color scheme. This involves selecting a few complementary colors that will be used throughout the website. Some popular color schemes include monochromatic (using different shades of the same color), complementary (using colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel), or analogous (using colors that are next to each other on the color wheel). Once a color scheme is chosen, it can be used to add color to various elements of the website, such as the background, text, headings, and links.

- Use images and graphics: Another way to add color to a website is by using images and graphics. This can include adding photographs, illustrations, or icons that incorporate colors from the chosen color scheme. Images can be used as backgrounds, or as elements within the design of the website.

- Add colored headings and text: Another way to incorporate color into a website is by adding colored headings and text. This can help draw attention to important information on the page, and can also make the page more visually interesting. When choosing colors for text, it's important to make sure that the color provides good contrast with the background, and is easy to read.

- Use colored buttons and links: Adding colored buttons and links is another way to add some color to a website. This can make it easier for users to navigate the site, and can also add visual interest to the design. Buttons and links can be designed in different shapes, sizes, and colors, and can be used to highlight important calls to action on the website.

## What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?

When choosing fonts for a website, I should consider how easy they are to read, whether they match the brand's personality, whether they work well on different devices, whether they help establish visual hierarchy, and whether they have enough contrast with the background. By keeping these factors in mind, I can choose fonts that are both functional and visually appealing, and that effectively communicate the desired message or brand identity.
 
 ## What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?
 
- Font-size: The font-size property sets the size of the text in an HTML element. It is typically specified in pixels, ems, or percentages. The default font size is usually 16 pixels.

- Font-weight: The font-weight property sets the thickness or boldness of the text in an HTML element. It can be set to various values, such as normal, bold, bolder, or lighter. The default font weight is usually normal.

- Font-style: The font-style property sets the style of the text in an HTML element. It can be set to various values, such as normal, italic, or oblique. The default font style is usually normal.

## Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.

- Padding: The padding property can be used to add space around the content of an element. To add space around the characters in an h1 element, you could use the padding property with a specific value, such as "padding: 10px;". This would add 10 pixels of space around all sides of the h1 element, effectively increasing the space around the characters as well.

- Letter-spacing: The letter-spacing property can be used to add space between characters in an element. To increase the space around characters in an h1 element, you could use the letter-spacing property with a specific value, such as "letter-spacing: 2px;". This would add 2 pixels of space between each character in the h1 element, creating a wider spacing around each character.
