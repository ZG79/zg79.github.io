## CSS Transform
CSS transform allows web developers to apply various transformations to HTML elements, such as rotating, scaling, skewing, and translating them in 2D or 3D space. CSS transform is supported by most modern web browsers, and can be implemented using CSS rules or inline styles. 

### What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?

Some common transform functions include : 

`rotate()`:  Rotate the element clockwise or counterclockwise around its center point.Negative number counter clockwise, positive number clockwise rotate.

`scale()` : Scale the element up or down by a certain factor.

`skew()`: Skew the element along the X or Y axis, or both.

`translate()`: Move the element up, down, left, or right on the screen.

`matrix()`: Apply a complex transformation using a matrix of values.

### Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.

I can use target element in JS and rotate(element) when clicked. 

### What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?

A CSS transition allows the developer to specify a gradual change in the style of an element over a period of time. Specifically, it allows the developer to define how an element should transition from one state to another when a specific event occurs, such as when the user hovers over the element or clicks on it.

I used transition on my Odd-Duck project.

When the page reloads the button comes in slowly. 

### How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?

CSS transitions are typically used to create a simple and subtle effect, while CSS animations are used for more complex and eye-catching effects.

### What are some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites?

CSS transitions can help make websites more engaging, visually appealing, and user-friendly while also improving website performance and reducing code complexity. CSS is recognizable for most of the modern browsers and hardware-accelerated, so without using JS complicated and slower code, we can use CSS to create much more visually appealing effects. 

### How this topic fit in with your long-term goals?

I find transition and other CSS animation to be so eye catching and something that can highlight the websites than the other similar websites. I'd like to learn more about it so I can use it on the websites that I'll make.
